         WEB API DOTNET CORE ANGULAR WITH DOCKER

       "General description of the Project"
       
I'm feel happy to share this project with you me because with this. I created one my favorites Web System from Scratch 
in asp.net core, I used jwt to strengthen security and SSL certificates for CORS and polities, also I used the bestes 
practices for the code and order from the same, interfaces, request, DTOs, enum, Entities, etc, was also important split 
the application in modules together with the WebApi and submodules like controllers, extensions, middleware, services 
and Models. 

I would like to add that this project is a part from the hudge systems that I have had the opportunity to do with other 
collaborators where I could use TDD, code rules and indentitation, sonarquabe among other tools to refactor the code
and also I used docker althought currently use kubernetes too, this only the part of the backend while that on Fronted
I used node js the version was 8.6.0 althoug actually I have using the most recently 12.0 for building in Angular and the
logic in Typescript together with services, directives, attributes, dependecy injection, components, etc.
The desigh was building with a part of HTML and Boostrap.
